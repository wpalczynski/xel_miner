This directory will store the ElasticPL Lib files created for each work package.

The ElasticPL Crypto libraries are contained in elasticpl_crypto.lib / libelastic_crypto.a  This library can be build using the source at:

    https://github.com/sprocket-fpga/elasticpl_crypto
    
I have included libraries for MSVC, MINGW, and my raspberry pi.  The MINGW and ARM libs need to be renamed before using.
